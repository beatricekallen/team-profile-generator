# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a Node.js application that uses both Inquirer and Jest to get information from the user about their employee team. The user is prompted to add a manager, and then has the option to add engineers and/or interns. When the user is done entering the information for their team, an index.html file is generated that can be opened in the browser to display the profile for each team member.
